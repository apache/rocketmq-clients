# RocketMQ Clients - Collection of Client Bindings for Apache RocketMQ

[![License][license-image]][license-url] [![Build][build-image]][build-url]

English | [ç®€ä½“ä¸­æ–‡](README-CN.md) | [RocketMQ Website](https://rocketmq.apache.org/)

## Overview

Client bindings for [Apache RocketMQ](https://rocketmq.apache.org/), as known as RocketMQ 5.x SDK. All of them follow the specification of [rocketmq-apis](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq-apis), replacing 4.x remoting-based counterparts. Clients in this repository are built on top of [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) and [gRPC](https://grpc.io/).

## Goal

Provide cloud-native and robust solutions for Java, C++, C#, Golang, Rust and all other mainstream programming languages.

## Prerequisite and Build

This project is organized as a monorepo, with each language's bindings containing specific instructions in their respective subdirectories for building the project. As the [rocketmq-apis](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq-apis) submodule is incorporated into the project and could be utilized by some bindings, we highly advise cloning the repository by executing the command below:

```sh
git clone --recursive git@github.com:apache/rocketmq-clients.git
```

## Contributing

Similar to other projects of Apache RocketMQ, any attempt to make this project better is welcome, including but not limited to filing a bug report, correcting type error or document writing to complete feature implementation. Do not hesitate to make a pull request if this project catches your attention.
